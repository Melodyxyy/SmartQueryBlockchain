# SmartQueryBlockchain

## Introduction
Welcome to SmartQueryBlockchain, an innovative project aiming to transform on-chain query execution within the blockchain ecosystem. This repository houses the codebase and documentation for the solution developed as part of the Data Analytics into Smart Contracts Hackathon (On-chain Query Execution).

## Project Overview
The challenge invites developers to pioneer a solution for executing complex queries directly on the blockchain. Our project focuses on empowering various sectors with real-time, data-driven decision-making capabilities through on-chain data.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following tools and frameworks installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/)
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SmartQueryBlockchain.git
   cd SmartQueryBlockchain
Install dependencies:

npm install
npm install web3
npm install react-router-dom
npm install @types/react-router-dom
npm install react-search-input

2.  **Configure Metamask:**

Connect Metamask to your local Ganache blockchain.

3. **Compile and migrate smart contracts:**

truffle compile
truffle migrate

## Technical Details
###  Smart Contracts
Our solution comprises smart contracts that facilitate on-chain query execution. Key contracts include:

QueryExecutor.sol: Handles the execution of complex queries.

DataStorage.sol: Manages on-chain storage of relevant data.

###  Data Handling
Data is securely handled on-chain to ensure transparency and integrity. Off-chain storage is implemented with chosen technology such as MongoDB/AWS/HDFS/IPFS/HBase, providing a resilient way to retrieve information for smart contract execution.
