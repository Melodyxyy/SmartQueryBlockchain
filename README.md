# Getting Started with SmartQueryBlockchain

Welcome to SmartQueryBlockchain, an innovative project aiming to transform on-chain query execution within the blockchain ecosystem. This repository houses the codebase and documentation for the solution developed as part of the Data Analytics into Smart Contracts Hackathon (On-chain Query Execution).

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# SmartQueryBlockchain

## Introduction
Welcome to SmartQueryBlockchain, an innovative project aiming to transform on-chain query execution within the blockchain ecosystem. This repository houses the codebase and documentation for the solution developed as part of the Data Analytics into Smart Contracts Hackathon (On-chain Query Execution).

## Project Overview
The challenge invites developers to pioneer a solution for executing complex queries directly on the blockchain. Our project focuses on empowering various sectors with real-time, data-driven decision-making capabilities through on-chain data.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following tools and frameworks installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/)
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SmartQueryBlockchain.git
   cd SmartQueryBlockchain
Install dependencies:

npm install
npm install web3
npm install react-router-dom
npm install @types/react-router-dom
npm install react-search-input

2.  **Configure Metamask:**

Connect Metamask to your local Ganache blockchain.

3. **Compile and migrate smart contracts:**

truffle compile
truffle migrate

## Project Structure

contracts/: Smart contract code

migrations/: Truffle migration scripts

tests/: Test scripts

docs/: Documentation files

## Technical Details
###  Smart Contracts
Our solution comprises smart contracts that facilitate on-chain query execution. Key contracts include:

QueryExecutor.sol: Handles the execution of complex queries.

DataStorage.sol: Manages on-chain storage of relevant data.

###  Data Handling
Data is securely handled on-chain to ensure transparency and integrity. Off-chain storage is implemented with chosen technology such as MongoDB/AWS/HDFS/IPFS/HBase, providing a resilient way to retrieve information for smart contract execution.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to enhance and refine our project. Follow these steps to contribute:
